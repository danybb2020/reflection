# Unit 14 HW

## Part 1: Reflection

- Reflect on what you have achieved so far in this course and answer the following questions:

### The Journey so Far
1. What have you learned so far?
I learned about full stack development . I got a handle on basic knowledge of all the technologies required to build applications both front end and back end and having them communicate with each other. But most importantly i learned that I enjoy front end more than backend

2. What have you accomplished?
I accomplished following along the course and finishing it, working with my teammates to create bigger projects and learned how to use the tehcnologis through homeworks and activities

3. Think back to the first week, how have you changed and grown since then?
I can identify and use full stack technologies that before were unknown to me and completely alien, if not completely confident with my skill I can at least know where I need to improve and grow 

### Path to Success
1. What are your goals for the remainder of the course?
Finish my homeworks, project and learn and hone the skills I have already acquired

2. What do you hope to accomplish before the course completes?
Finish my goals and learn other things I need to work on in the future 

3. What do you hope to accomplish after the course completes?
Take a frontend course, specially react and probably later find a job in the tech sector. Probably more focused in technical project management more than software development

4. What strategies will you employ to ensure you accomplish these goals?
Practice my skills more , get some more knowledge and continue engaging with my peers

5. How do these plans and goals differ from the first half of the course?
I had thought about becoming a fullstack developer at first
